          <p>The JB 11 is powered by six turbo jet engines specially modified for vertical flight. Each engine produces approximately 90lbs of thrust. A sophisticated engine computer balances thrust between engines and in the unlikely case of an engine failure it will enable the pilot to maintain control and land. We design all computer hardware and write all code in-house.

The JB11 can carry a heavier fuel load and hence has longer endurance than the JB10.

As for the JB10, the JB11 can be operated either in the Ultralight or Experimental category.</p>
